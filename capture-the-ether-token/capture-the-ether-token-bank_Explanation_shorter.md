The TokenBankChallenge contract has a re-entrancy vulnerability in the withdraw() function due to the balance update occurring after token.transfer(). The exploit involves a separate TokenBankAttacker contract. When the attacker deposits tokens and calls attack(), the flawed withdraw() is triggered, and TokenBankChallenge calls TokenBankAttacker's tokenFallback(). The attacker repeatedly calls withdraw() within tokenFallback(), draining the contract's tokens. The challenge is complete when isComplete() returns true, indicating all tokens are drained.
